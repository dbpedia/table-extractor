class Analyzer:
    """
    Analyzer class takes resources from a list and call a HtmlTableParser  over them.

    It takes resources from .txt file (generally created by Selector objects) or from a string if a single_resource is
     involved.
    Therefore a Table Parser object (Html or Json), it depends on mode chosen, is called over their wiki page
     representation.
     This representation is retrieved by a utilities object (calling html_object_getter()).
    Once the list of resources is finished or the analysis of a resource is done some useful statistics values are set.
    Some of them are passed to the utilities object (res_analyzed), as they are useful to print a final cumulative
     report, while some others (headers with no mapping rules found) are just print out and to the log.
    They are used to give to the user an idea of which headers he can find in tables but which has not yet a
     corresponding mapping rule. This is so important, as tables in wiki pages (even in pages with same topic
     or describing the same phenomenons) are as well heterogeneous as the taste of users who wrote them.

    Public Methods:
        -analyze(): it is used to analyze a list of resources(or a single resource) passed once analyzer has been
            initialized. Once you have created Analyzer object simply call this method to begin the analysis.
            This method doesn't return nothing by itself as useful informations are printed out both in the log and in the
            console.

        -serialize(): method used to serialize the RDF graph fulfilled with triples during analysis (mapping) phase.
            it creates a .ttl file (serialization of the RDF graph).
            Filename and directory (it should be /Extractions) are reported in the log.
            Please call serialize() after analyze() method!

        Analyzer object takes resources from a list and call a TableParser (html |json) over them.

        Please, after initialization, use the analyze() method to start the analysis and the serialize() one to
         serialize the RDF graph.
        During the initialization a rdf graph is created (the class need rdflib to work) and a iterator is set over the
         list of resources or over the single_resource passed.

        Arguments:
        :param chapter (str): a two alpha-characters string representing the chapter of wikipedia user chose.

                print a final report.

            of wiki pages (with spaces replaced by underscores Eg. Elezioni_amministrative_italiane_del_2016).
            Note that filename is mutual exclusive with single_res (if one is set, the other should not)
